Wednesday Aug 9, 1899
Last night the story of the [horse] with his head where his tail ought to be. Sat up all day at the window and watched the geysers and passing stages filled with tourists. Inquisitive people and kind 

people. Feel much better today. Miss Bessie Hayne’s sent me a bowl of clear broth for supper. Missed out with the office in the evening and Miss Hayne’s called and brought more chocolate fudge and spent the evening. Bears came to the [piazza] and coyotes made [considerable] worse. Bed at 9 – Restless night.
