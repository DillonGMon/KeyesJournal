Stopped at stream flowing with the  Gallatin for lunch at 12 – Washed feet in stream [at] – Started again in walk after lunch – Sayles shot a partridge with revolver and killed three snakes – Found by the party some alabaster and asbestos. Carl found some quartz, opal and calcite in one piece. Saw several badgers, woodchucks etc. but not deer. Finally after long lot, dusty, tiresome walk arrived at our camping ground in the lower basin (see map) distance covered today = 19 miles – Supper of ham, potatoes, tomatoes, bread, and prunes Also lime juice and last of all plenty of [milk] from neighboring ranches. Sat around the camp fire I was busy with pack until bed time. Bed at 9.30. Hathaway pretty well done up. The rest pretty tired but well and happy. Feeling fine myself. Round the camp fire.
