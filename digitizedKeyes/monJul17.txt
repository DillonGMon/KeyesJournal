Trail very old and poorly marked by blazed trees. For almost five miles all was well. Then reached slate ridge and went astray wandered in search of trail for almost an hour Finally started up a spur of the Gallatin Mt – Fine view from top – hard climbing – [snowballing] – some mosquitos at same time – descent of after spur – very steep – crossed three ridges over range ground and vague trail – crossed snow slide or glacier – fallen timber in great masses. Our pack horse fell down – Terribly tired and hard [climbing]

Beautiful view of snow capped Lone Mt and surrounding fields.
